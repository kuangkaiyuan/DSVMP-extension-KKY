Dear Professor Spafford,

Please find attached our paper entitled "Enhance Virtual-Machine-Based Code Obfuscation Security through Dynamic Bytecode Scheduling" which we wish to submit for publication in Computers & Security.

A preliminary version of this article entitled "Exploiting Dynamic Scheduling for VM-Based Code Obfuscation" by K. Kuang et el. appeared in the 15th IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications (TrustCom), 2016. 

The extended version makes the several additional contributions over the conference paper:

1. It provides a more detailed description of the background and threat model (Sections 2 and 3); 

2. It describes how the virtual interpreter dynamically changes the execution path at runtime using an algorithmic model (Section 6.2 and Algorithm 1);

3. It provides new experimental results to evaluate the overhead of the proposed technique, providing new insights of the approach (Section 9.2); 

4. It adds a new experiment to evaluate the diversity of the protected structure at runtime (Section 9.3); 

5. It includes new results to compare the proposed approach against two commercial VM protection systems, Code Virtualizer and VMProtect (Section 9.4).


Yours faithfully

Kuangkai Yuan
